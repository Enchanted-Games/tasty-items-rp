A list of people who have contributed to the pack in some way or have inspired me in general.
    all textures in this pack are original and are based on the vanilla Minecraft assets

- Amaro Lun√°tico: Made the raw beef animation (shortened to 6 frames from 11)
- KilianFelix: Made the pumpkin pie animation (first two frames slightly modified)

- theoness1: Made the Food Animations mod that was an inspiration for this pack
