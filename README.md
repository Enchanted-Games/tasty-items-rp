# Tasty Items

Tasty Items is a resourcepack that adds eating animations to food and other consumable items with no mods! It uses new item definitions introduced in 24w45a, meaning you will need to be in any version above that for this to work.

This pack uses all original textures and includes some extra things, such as carrots and potions being rotated to your mouth when consuming them.

**_Hey, wasn't this done before?_**

There have been mods that add a similar feature in the past, however this resourcepack works in vanilla so you don't need mods for it to work!

## Current Items

This pack currently only adds animations to a few items (see dropdown for full list). More will be added in the future, I want to avoid doing every single food until this feature is finalised and out of the snapshot phase

## Game Versions

You need to be in 24w45a or above for this to work. You don't need any mods installed.

**I will not backport this to older versions for two reasons:**

- It's literally impossible without making a specialised mod
- There are mods for older versions that do a similar thing

## Credits

- **Amaro Lunático**: Made the raw beef animation (shortened to 6 frames from 11)
- **KilianFelix**: Made the pumpkin pie animation (first two frames slightly modified)
- **theoness1**: Made the Food Animations mod that was an inspiration for this pack
